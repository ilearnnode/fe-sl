# AI Tools Usage Documentation

## Overview
This document describes how Claude Code was used to complete the Sports League viewer assignment.

## Tools and Assistance Provided

### 1. Project Architecture and Setup
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Usage**:
  - Generated complete Vue.js + TypeScript + Vite project structure
  - Configured Tailwind CSS using the latest Vite plugin approach (@tailwindcss/vite)
  - Set up proper TypeScript typing for all components and services

### 2. Component Design and Implementation
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Usage**:
  - Designed and implemented a component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Created reusable components: LeagueItem, LeagueList, SearchBar, SportFilter, and BadgeModal
  - Implemented Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript for type safety

### 3. API Integration
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Usage**:
  - Built an API service class with built-in caching mechanism
  - Implemented proper error handling and loading states
  - Used TypeScript interfaces for API response typing

### 4. Features Implementation
- **Tool**: Claude Code
- **Usage**:
  - Implemented search functionality with real-time filtering
  - Added sport type dropdown filter with dynamic options
  - Created modal component for displaying season badges
  - Ensured responsive design using Tailwind CSS utilities

## Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Caching Strategy**: Implemented in-memory caching with 5-minute TTL to avoid redundant API calls
2. **Component Architecture**: Used Vue 3's Composition API for better TypeScript integration
3. **Styling**: Chose Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive UI development
4. **State Management**: Used reactive refs and computed properties for efficient state management
5. **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error states with retry functionality

## Time Efficiency
Using Claude Code allowed for:
- Rapid scaffolding of the entire application structure
- Immediate implementation of best practices and patterns
- Quick iteration on component design and functionality
- Focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code

The entire implementation was completed well within the 90-minute timeframe, including all required features and additional enhancements like loading states and error handling.
